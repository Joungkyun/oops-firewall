OOPS Firewall README

$Id$


This document is for OOPS Firewall 7.x tree.


OOPS Firewall is the iptables frontend for a simple-to-use firewall
configuration that controls packet filtering, bridge firewall, masquerade
system, port forwarding, etc on the Linux kernel 2.4 or late.

This is default firewall on AnNyung LInux, and support Redhat compatible
distributions and debian compatible distirbutions over kernel 2.4.


OOPS Firewall 7.x tree is as follows.


1. enhanced input / output processing
2. support bridge firewall
3. support transparent proxy (Masquerading)
4. support port forwarding
5. support user define rules


By current design, WAN conenction is not limited. Bridge mode is composed
1 WAN device and 1 LAN device and Masquerade mode is same with Bridge mode.

Composition as an example, as follow.


              FIREWALL

            ┌──────────┐
        ┌─┴─┐            ┌─┴─┐
  WAN ─┤eth0  ├─ BRIDGE ─┤ eth2 ├─ Bridge Zone
        └─┬─┘    (br0)   └─┬─┘    (Public Network)
            │                    │
        ┌─┴─┐            ┌─┴─┐
  WAN ─┤ eth1 ├─ MASQ   ─┤ eth3 ├─ Transparant proxy Zone
        └─┬─┘            └─┬─┘    (Private Network)
            └──────────┘

  * Example fo interface.conf configuration:
     FIREWALL_WAN = br0 eth1
     MASQUERADE_WAN = eth1
     MASQUERADE_LOC = eth3
     BRIDGE_DEVNAME = br0
     BRIDGE_WANDEV  = eth0
     BRIDGE_LANDEV  = eth2


If you have multiple interfaces, you can set multiple interface to
FIREWALL_WAN directive with separated by a white space. And the value
of same is not available on BRIDGE_LANDEV and MASQUERADE_LOC directive.

If Bridge WAN device and Masquerading WAN device are same, in other words,
a structure like following figures:

              FIREWALL

            ┌─────────┐
        ┌─┴─┐          ┌─┴─┐
  WAN ─┤eth0  ├ BRIDGE ─┤eth1  ├─ Bridge Zone
        └─┬┬┘  (br0)   └─┬─┘    (Public Network)
            ││                │
            ││            ┌─┴─┐
            │└─ MASQ   ─┤eth2  ├─ Transparant proxy Zone
            │              └─┬─┘    (Private Network)
            └─────────┘

  * Example fo interface.conf configuration:
     FIREWALL_WAN = br0
     MASQUERADE_WAN = br0
     MASQUERADE_LOC = eth2
     BRIDGE_DEVNAME = br0
     BRIDGE_WANDEV  = eth0
     BRIDGE_LANDEV  = eth1
