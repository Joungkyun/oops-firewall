First, sorry for my poor english :-)


This document gives a description of OOPS Firewall 6.x installation.

4. Operation init script
5. oops-firewall options
6. Compatibility with old version



1. Attention
------------

OOPS Firewall is server side packet filtering firewall (or bridge firewall)
for Redhat or Redhat compatibility distributions. Also this is frontend that
easly used iptables. So, It needs kernel 2.4 or kernel 2.6 and, iptables
package.

On Redhat or Redhat compatibility distributions, they support basic fireall
that has same purpose with oops-firewall. For example, there is lokkit or
/etc/init.d/iptables and /etc/sysconfig/iptables of iptables package.

OOPS Firewall conflicts with this basic firewall of Redhat distribution, and
needs follow steps.

1. stop iptables init script
   shell> service iptables stop
   or
   shell> /etc/init.d/iptables stop

2. remove booting process on ntsysv or chkconfig list
   shell> chkconfig --del iptables


OOPS Firewall is basic firewall on AnNyung LInux and developed
on AnNyung LInux.



2. The production of RPM package
--------------------------------

OOPS Firewall is designed on Redhat compatible distribution. So on other
distributions, needs code modifying. If you Debian or Ubuntu distribution,
read README.debian document.

OOPS Firewall is recommanded that install as rpm package. For make RPM
package, use follow command.

shell> rpmbuild -tb oops-firewall-6.2.6.tar.bz2

After building, you can find new package on /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch.

If you want to know installed file list, you can use follow command.

shell> rpm -qlv oops-firewall

If oops-firewall is not installed, you can get file list of rpm package
with follow command.

shell> rpm -qlvp oops-firewall-6.2.6-1.noarch.rpm



3. Build with byhand
--------------------

OOPS Firewall support configure and make since version 4.0.0. (This don't
means that use autoconf/automake.) So, you can install easily following process.

./configure
make
make install

If you want to know detail options, can use `./configure --help` command.

[oops@main oops-firewall]$ ./configure --help

Usage: ./configure [option]
Options: [defaults in brackets after descriptions]
Configuration:
  --prefix=PREFIX   install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [/usr/local/]
  --bindir=DIR      user executables in DIR [PREFIX/bin]
  --confdir=DIR     default path of *.conf in DIR [PREFIX/etc/oops-firewall]
  --includedir=DIR  header files [PREFIX/include/oops-firewall]
  --shareddir=DIR   modifiable architecture-independent data in DIR [PREFIX/share]
  --initdir=DIR     redhat init script path [/etc/rc.d/init.d]
  --destdir=DIR     Absulute path !! for needed packaging
  --userpath=DIR,.. Additional PATH environment varibles

Check Utility:
  --perl=PATH       path of perl
  --iptables=PATH   path of iptables

When make install, you can use DESTDIR environment variable.

make DESTDIR=/path install

If you excute upper command, install files are located under /path.



4. Operation init script
------------------------

If you can use Redhat init script. When you built by hand, copy init file
to /etc/init.d

shell> cp -af contrib/oops-firewall.init.redhat /etc/init.d/oops-firewall

For auto start oops-firewall on booting time, you can use ntsysv or chkconfig
command.

First, execute ntsysv by root privileges:

shell> ntsysv

And then, check oops-firewall.

If you use chkconfig instead of ntsysv, execute follow commands.

shell> chkconfig --add oops-firewall
shell> chkconfig --level 35 oops-firewall on

For start or stop operation:

shell> /sbin/service oops-firewall {start|stop|restart}

or

shell> /etc/init.d/oops-firewall {start|stop|restart}


Attention!
On bridge mode, stop action of init script is down bridge interface. This
time, network connection is lost for several seconds. If you want to regist
only new ruleset, you can use restart of right-stop action. (restart action
is composed right-stop and start)

On no brkdge mode, stop is same with right-stop.



5. oops-firewall options
------------------------

When start OOPS firewall, existed ruleset is initialized and then added
new ruleset. So, even if occured changing ruleset, you don't need init
script stop/start process. You can execute 'oops-fierwall -v' command on
shell prompt.


Usage: oops-firewall -[actvVh]
Options:
         -a                     Bridge interface force down
         -c config_directory    user define configuration directory
         -t                     test mode (actually don't execute)
         -v                     verbose mode
         -V                     print current oops-firewall version
         -h                     help messages (this messages)



6. Compatibility with old version
---------------------------------

By default, configuration between 5.x and 6.x has been designed to be
compatible. But, I don't care some missing. So, I recommand that you
should be reconfiguration.

If you update with rpm from 5.x to 6.x, first remove or rename old
configuration directory or files and then, update rpm to 6.x.
